# Player Overall and Market Value Prediction Using FIFA 19 Dataset

This project leverages the FIFA 19 dataset to predict the overall ratings and market values of football players using various machine learning models. The dataset, which includes detailed attributes such as age, nationality, club, skill ratings, and financial metrics, was meticulously preprocessed to handle missing values, encode categorical variables, normalize numerical features, and remove outliers. We then split the data into training and testing sets to develop and evaluate multiple regression models, including Linear Regression, Ridge Regression, ElasticNet, Random Forest, and LassoLars.

Our results indicate that Linear Regression and Ridge Regression models performed the best, achieving the lowest Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) of approximately 2.13. This project demonstrates the potential of using data-driven approaches to assess player performance and market value, offering valuable insights for football clubs and analysts. The code and dataset are available in this repository, and we welcome contributions to further refine and enhance the models.
